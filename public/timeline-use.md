## Overview

This report is used to generate a high level overview of upcoming milestones as something
that can be put in a PowerPoint or Google Slide.


## Privacy Policy

This project does NOT save any JIRA data.  In fact, other than transporting an access token
to the browser, no JIRA data even flows through our servers.  

All the code is open source in [Github Issue](https://github.com/bitovi/jira-timeline-report) so you can verify this yourself or host it yourself.

## Getting Started

Bitovi's [Agile Project Management with Jira - Reporting](https://www.bitovi.com/academy/learn-agile-program-management-with-jira/reporting.html) training walks through 
configuring the tool.

Note, your epics and initiatives will need the following statuses for the tool to work:

- `Idea`, `To Do`, or `Open` representing ideas that you might not want on the report.
- `QA` or `In QA` - represending work that is in QA.
- `Partner Review` or `UAT` - representing work that is in user acceptance testing.
- `Blocked` - represending work that can not move forward.
- `Done` or `Cancelled` - Work that is complete and will be hidden from the report.

The [Agile Project Management with Jira - Continuous Exploration](https://www.bitovi.com/academy/learn-agile-program-management-with-jira/continuous-exploration-board.html) training has 
videos on how to create an initiative type with the right statuses.
